AeroGPT: A GPT Model for the Aviation Industry

AeroGPT is a custom-trained GPT-2 model tailored specifically for the aviation industry. Developed by Decima Technologies, this model aims to assist various aviation stakeholders, including airlines, air traffic controllers, maintenance crews, customer service representatives, and passengers. 

AeroGPT can generate contextually relevant responses for various aviation-related scenarios, making it an essential tool for enhancing efficiency, safety, and customer experience in the aviation sector.

# Why AeroGPT?

The aviation industry is complex and highly regulated, requiring precise communication and adherence to strict protocols. AeroGPT helps streamline these communications by providing:

-Customer Service Automation: Assist passengers with booking, flight status, baggage inquiries, and more.

-Flight Operations: Offer quick references for in-flight procedures, emergency protocols, and weather-related decision-making.

-Maintenance and Safety: Support maintenance crews with troubleshooting guidance, checklists, and safety compliance checks.

-Air Traffic Management: Facilitate clear and accurate communication between pilots and air traffic controllers.

-Training and Education: Act as an educational tool for pilots, air traffic controllers, and maintenance personnel by providing access to aviation knowledge.

# Key Features

Domain-Specific Knowledge: Trained on a diverse set of aviation texts, including flight procedures, safety regulations, maintenance protocols, and customer service guidelines.

Context-Aware Responses: Generates responses that are contextually relevant to a wide range of aviation scenarios.

Easy Integration: AeroGPT can be integrated into existing aviation software systems, customer service chatbots, and other applications.

Open Source: Released for public use to encourage innovation and enhance the overall quality of aviation services.

# How to Use AeroGPT
# Prerequisites


-Python 3.6+

-PyTorch

-Transformers Library (Hugging Face)

-Other dependencies as listed in requirements.txt

# Installation
# Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/DecimaASI007/aerogpt.git

cd aerogpt

# Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download the Model and Tokenizer 

The AeroGPT model and tokenizer can be downloaded directly from this repository:

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

#Load AeroGPT model and tokenizer

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('./aerogpt-model')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('./aerogpt-tokenizer')

# Usage
# Basic Text Generation
You can use AeroGPT to generate aviation-related responses using the following Python script:

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

#Load AeroGPT model and tokenizer

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('./aerogpt-model')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('./aerogpt-tokenizer')

#Input prompt for text generation

prompt = "What are the pre-flight safety checks for a commercial airline?"

#Encode the input prompt

input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')

#Generate text

output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)

#Decode and print the generated text

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)

# Example Outputs
1. Flight Operations:

Input: "What should a pilot do in case of engine failure?"

Output: "In the event of an engine failure, the pilot should follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) outlined in the aircraft's operating manual. This typically includes maintaining control of the aircraft, establishing best glide speed, identifying a suitable landing site, and communicating with air traffic control (ATC)."

2. Customer Service:

Input: "What is the baggage allowance for economy class?"

Output: "The baggage allowance for economy class passengers is typically 23kg. Please check with your specific airline for their policies and any additional fees for excess baggage."
